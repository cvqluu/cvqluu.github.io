## (Van Quy) Chau Luu 

pronouns: he/him

I am a speech/machine learning scientist. I did my PhD (passed, pending minor corrections) at the University of Edinburgh, [Centre for Speech Technology Research](https://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/), supervised by Dr. Peter Bell and Prof. Steve Renals. I have also spent time working at Amazon Alexa as an Applied Scientist for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR).

I'm also the primary contributor to [u/animalsupportbot](https://www.reddit.com/user/animalsupportbot/), an educational reddit bot that can respond to common questions/myths/fallacies about veganism using NLP.
